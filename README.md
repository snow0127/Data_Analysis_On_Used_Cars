# 🚗 Data Analysis on Used Cars

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a used cars dataset to understand the key factors influencing car prices.  
The analysis is implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights about resale value based on features such as mileage, fuel type, transmission, manufacturing year, and more.
